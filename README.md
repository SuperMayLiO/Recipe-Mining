# Recipe-Mining

We applied data mining techniques, containing unsupervised learning and supervised learning to exploring the world of recipe. Before we start, we used web parsing techniques to crawl different kinds of recipe all over the world from website, BBC GoodFood.com.

Social Network Analysis, which is an unsupervised learning, is to explore European Cuisine Culture, instead of qualitative way. Besides, we also found out what were the common ingredients for diverse Europe Regions shared or their unique cuisine culture. According to this technique, we think this new idea could be applied in market research instead of original way.

Considering lots of unsupervised learning, we try to predict reviewers’ average ranking to help website manage before the new recipes were posted. If the average rating was lower, website manager could adjust them previously. In the meanwhile, we also used text mining to dig more about website reviewers’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction. By doing this, we can totally understand what website’s reviewers think, finding something interesting in their behavior.
