# Knowledge Discovery of Online Recipe Reviews Using Text Mining

- ## Abstract
The goal is to discover and explore Europe recipe experience world. Therefore, this experiment is conducted to utilize critical incidence and K-means clustering analysis to create ontology. Firstly, collect recipe samples from four European regions to build the clusters of positive and negative recipe experience; however, there’s no special pattern in clusters for creating ontology. Secondly, build clusters of positive and negative recipe experience for Europe recipes; however, there’s just a little pattern for creating ontology. Finally, partitioning same samples into two categories, i.e. “Dish” and “Others” (dessert & salad & soup) of Europe recipes, and building 4 clusters of both positive and negative recipe experience and finding ideas to create ontology.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet has gradually affected people’s lives, people would like to share their experience on the web, including recipe experience. The website, BBC Good Food was founded in 2001, which was made by BBC Worldwide and was a commercial company owned by BBC, provides with about 9000 recipes of their magazine on this website. Moreover, establishing a platform for online reviewers who followed this recipe before to share their experience and modification for each recipe! 

With regard to Rese, Schreiber, and Baier (2014) mentioned a technique, text mining which was applied to this experiment to identify important adjective pairs out of the online reviews of IKEA's mobile catalogue app, which gave a more realistic picture of the difficulties and problems than traditional approaches, e.g. using questionnaires, to measure technology acceptance. Additionally, result shows that it not only contributes valuable ideas for technical improvements to the mobile IKEA catalogue app, but can be replaced by the analysis of online reviews with comparison survey. Therefore, applying this research to my further studies to find out whether important incidents/words exists in recipe can be more possible to be executed. In other words, in this experiment, is to discover the critical incidents in online reviews from website, BBC Good Food.

From Trappey, Wu, and Liu (2012), further experiment is conducted to apply their Kaohsiung MRT ontology to accomplish further research by making cooking experience ontology from online reviews of BBC Good Food depending on various recipes. Lee, and Hu (2004) showed a similar way to understand critical incidents, appearing in hotel customers from website, e-Complaints. Furthermore, this experiment is conducted to group customers’ descriptive comments about hotel service, called cluster analysis–examining keyword association by grouping identified important keywords based on Ward’s clustering method. This further research can be conducted by applying with another hierarchical method, but changing to use another algorithm, called K-means, which is also for clustering but it’s nonhierarchical clustering, to discover whether there’re critical incidents in online recipe reviews, and being clustered by some association. With regard to the idea of Teng, Lin, and Adamic (2012), the experiment was conducted to use the comments from a recipe website, Joy of Cooking, to modify the recipes, which is similar to further research with similar way, called text mining, and to find out critical incidents in recipes’ reviews; however, further research is conducted to adjust previous idea to focus on only one country, United Kingdom, data collected from website, BBC Good Food. On one hand, utilizing online reviews below each recipe, which were posted by almost U.K. people who followed this recipe before; therefore, we can try to find out how to adjust recipes from BBC Good Food in order to realize U.K. customers’ taste before bringing out new dishes, which can prevent new dishes from failure. In other words, adjusting recipes helps lead dishes to success. Besides, focusing on what people like and strengthen their satisfaction, which also can be a great thing! On the other hand, with regard to Ahn, Ahnert, Bagrow, and Barabasi (2011), this experiment was conducted to use two American repositories and avoid a distinctly Western interpretation of the world’s cuisine, also used a Korean repository at the same time. Besides, the results showed that the correlation between different datasets (recipes of different repositories), representing two distinct perspectives on food. From this, this experiment can be conducted to focus on recipes, which demonstrate U.K. tastes and recipe experience with U.K. style because all recipes collected from an English website, BBC Good Food.

About recipe modification, transforming the core idea from Teng, Lin, and Adamic (2012), and all techniques mentioned previously, the goal for this experiment is conducted to separate two parts by analyzing negative recipe experience and positive recipe experience depending on reviewers’ ranking for recipes to dig more in U.K. people’s taste on recipes!

## 2. Methodology
We try to use critical incident analysis to discover what BBC Good Food users experience when they followed these recipes previously, which is similar to Yan, and Zhang (2006), trying to apply this technique to build customer complaint ontology; therefore, this experiment is to focus on Europe recipes, building U.K. people’s recipe experience ontology. Furthermore, we use K-means clustering analysis with the key phrase dimensions (Trappey, Wu, and Liu, 2012) and discovering knowledge about what U.K. people experience in European recipes and how they feel about European cuisine!

- ## Data preprocessing
This experiment is conducted to collect and clean about 9000 recipes from website, BBC Good Food, through two software, Python and R; however, we only use 8331 recipes, which contain four European regions: Western Europe with 6499 recipes, Northern Europe with 130 recipes, Central Europe with 65 recipes, and Southern Europe with 1637 recipes because data resources from website, BBC Good Food.com, provided with less Eastern Europe recipes. Therefore, we only focus on four European regions. Moreover, randomly sampling 50 recipes from each region to prevent the problem that Northern Europe and Central Europe have few recipes. In sum, this experiment is conducted to use 200 samples from 8331 recipes to find out some interesting things in European cuisine world.

To build two kinds of attitude ontology, the first step in processing the recipes is defining positive part and negative part from comments of each European region recipes. We remove intermediate attitude, or the star ranking of reviewers were 2.5 stars (from decimal viewpoint), and 3 stars (from integer viewpoint) depending on total ranking, 5 stars. On one hand, regarding what’s greater than 3 stars as positive attitude for four European regions. On the other hand, regarding what’s less than 2.5 stars as negative attitude for four European regions. Besides, we put dialogues together if there’re the same reviewers for two attitudes!
The next step in processing the recipes is to remove something meaningless, such as notation (e.g. -/), stop word, i.e. is a commonly used word (e.g. of, for, a, the), numbers, and space. Besides, also transform all words to small letter to distinguish repeated words.

- ## Critical Incident Analysis
Critical incident technique consists of a set of procedures for collecting direct observations of human behavior to facilitate their potential usefulness in solving practical problems (Flanagan, 1954). Besides, it can be used to construct an open-ended website users’ comments to analyze from the positive and negative viewpoints of users describing their cooking experiences, as the similar application from Trappey, Wu, and Liu (2012), who use open-ended customer questionnaire to collect the positive and negative text dialogues of passengers describing their transportation experiences. In this research, we will collect people’s comments on website, BBC Good Food, to know users’ detailed experience using their own words and explanations. The table shows how many positive and negative dialogues for four regions (Table.1).

- ## Text Mining Analysis
In order to extract the keywords from recipe reviews, this experiment is conducted to count the weights of words by following way. Utilizing the method proposed by Salton and Buckley (1988), we can calculate Term Frequency (TF) minus Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). TF is measuring number of times a word appears in a recipe review, and IDF is measuring number of times the word appears in all reviews, which are either positive dialogues or negative dialogues from four European regions mentioned before. This method was combined the idea of TF, proposed by Luhn (1957), with the idea of IDF, proposed by Jones, K. S. (1972). However, in order to solve the problem that the length of dialogue (i.e. recipe comments) will affect the weight of words, then use the method, Normalized Term Frequency (NTF) minus Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), proposed by Sedding, and Kazakov (2004). Therefore, in this experiment, we calculate NTF minus IDF to give appropriate weights of words, choosing top 50 words from top 100 words, using domain knowledge to pick vital or meaningful words manually.

- ### K-means clustering analysis. 
Additionally, according to top 50 keywords selected, we then use K-means clustering analysis with the keyword dimensions (Trappey, Wu, &Liu, 2012). In other words, we desire to discover some patterns to help us build U.K. people’s recipe experience ontology. However, when utilizing K-means clustering, creating clusters to see whether there’re different patterns for positive and negative dialogues in four regions, the results show no special patterns to explain in each cluster (Figure.1~Figure.8). Moreover, because sample sizes for negative dialogues are too small in four European regions (Table.1), this experiment shows that there’re only ten keywords extracted from negative dialogues in four regions. Besides, we think that if people do not like the recipes, they won’t go back to comment on recipes they followed before. Therefore, we try to combine 200 samples of four European regions to see positive and negative recipe experience in Europe, finding keywords for recipe experience clustering! Besides, the number of positive dialogue is 1065, negative dialogue is 104 (see the dataset in appendix A). 

- ### Recipe experience ontology. The final step here is to use clusters created previously to give an idea for creating positive and negative Europe recipe experience ontology for U.K. people (e.g. Trappey, Wu, & Liu ,2012; Yan, & Zhang ,2006).

## 3. Results
A total of 4 clusters were derived from both good and bad experiences for 200 samples of Europe recipes (actual comments for 200 samples of Europe recipes are in Appendix A). Figure 9 depicts the good experiences. However, we can only find special patterns in forth cluster. The forth cluster relates to the topic about breakfast, and shows something that people love in breakfast; in other words, dried fruit and nut topping on yoghurt, and syrup spreading across granola, which depicting a wonderful morning (R codes are in Appendix C and Appendix D) !

Figure 10 depicts the bad experiences. However, we cannot find any special pattern in these four clusters, which means we have to change to another way, exploring more recipe experiences from reviewers!
